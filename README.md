Dotfiles
========

So I've made a ton of updates over the past few months to these dotfiles. One big notable exception right now is that `neovim` isn't managed in this file simply because I'm not comfortable enough with its configuration yet. That said, these files are doing a lot more now than they've ever done. On my Linux desktop, I'm running Hyprland at the moment and the configuration for both it and Quickshell.

I'm working to learn Quickshell. I have a long way to go.
